snippet="CardStock is a desktop app that lets you quickly and easily build graphical programs, called stacks, which can be made up of multiple pages called cards. It provides a drawing-program-like editor for building Graphical User Interfaces, and a code editor for adding event-driven python code. CardStock also allows you to upload your stacks here, to cardstock.run, so they can be run in a web browser, and shared more easily."
